# Deep Learning 1 - Master Data Science, Institut Polytechnique de Paris

This repository contains my practical work and projects completed for the **Deep Learning 1** course of the Master Data Science program at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, taught by **Geoffroy Peeters**.

## Contents:
- **Practical assignments**: implementations of basic to advanced neural networks, regularization, optimization.
- **Projects**: projects using architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and more.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing experiments and analyses.
- **Reports**: documents explaining the theoretical concepts covered and the results obtained.

## Objectives:
The aim of this course is to understand the foundations of neural networks and deepen concepts such as:
- Supervised learning with deep neural networks.
- Regularization and normalization techniques.
- Optimization of neural networks.
- Practical applications of deep learning.

## Working Environment:
- **Language**: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Dependencies**: see `requirements.txt`
